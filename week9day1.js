//! How does AWS Lambda work for:
//? a. File Processing
//In File processing , lambda runs as it gets triggers right after a file upload was put in the Amazon S3 bucket.
//? b. Web Applications
//When user interacts with the UI of the web application, and API gateway has been made, lambda is triggered to perform a function wherein it gets json data from the dynamoDB.
//? c. Stream Processing

//! What is AWS VPC?
// AWS VPC or virtual private cloud provides users with full control over the virtual networking environmment, including resource placement, connectivity, and security.

//! How does AWS VPC work?
// This virtual network has the advantages of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS while closely resembling a conventional network that you would operate in your own data center.

//! What are some use cases of VPC?
// Some uses cases of using virtual private cloud if for you to networking administrator stuffs and add subnets.

//! What is API Gateway?
// In order to construct, publish, maintain, monitor, and protect APIs at any size, developers may use the fully managed service known as Amazon API Gateway. Applications use APIs as their "front door" to data, business logic, or functionality in your backend services.

//! How does API Gateway work?
// API gateway creates RESTful APIs that are HTTP based, it enables stateless clien-server communication, and implement standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE

//! What are some use cases of API Gateway?
// API gateways are use by IoT devices, web and mobile applications, connected users and streaming dashboards. API gateway

//! 21. What is CloudFront?
// Excellent performance, security, and developer friendliness are the main priorities of the content delivery network (CDN) service Amazon CloudFront.

//! 22. How does CloudFront work?
// Amazon cloudfront is responsible in making the users of website/IoT devices speeds up the distribution of your web content and your image files. When there is cloudfront in your AWS, it helps with delivering your contents throughout the world's data centers which are called edge locations. When users are accessing your sites, the request the user wants is routed to the edge locations where there is less latency.

//! 23. What are some use cases of CloudFront?
// Best use cases of cloudfront is when you want users to experience the most convenient way possible in accessing your web services. In this way, you can provide users with less wait time, which in turn, turns into profit, because time is money.

//! 24. What is Cognito?
// Amazon cognito is a user identity and data synchronization service that makes it easy for developers to manage users from your application across multiple devices of the users/customers.

//! 25. How does Cognito work?
// Amazon Cognito works by helping you integrate user sign-in and signup, and you could also sign in by using your FB, Google, and other popular site accounts. It can also help you sync user data so that you can let users jump between different devices with ease.

//! 26. What are some use cases of Cognito?
// The use case of Cognito is for you to manage user sign-ups and sign-in, with the inclusion of letting the users of your application use third-party accounts from popular websites. It can also help if developers have their applications on multiple devices because Cognito helps with syncing.

//! 27. What is CloudWatch?
// Cloudwatch is a monitoring and management service built for developers, system operators, engineers, and IT managers. It provides data and actionable insights to monitor your application.

//! 28. How does CloudWatch work?
